    Missing values are filled with -1. Missing values are values missing from the spline.

    the lines could be interpolated in 3D, a better approach to spline interpolation could
    be used, there is barely any error checking, sometimes the splines oscillate too much.
    This was used for a quick poly-line regression training only.
