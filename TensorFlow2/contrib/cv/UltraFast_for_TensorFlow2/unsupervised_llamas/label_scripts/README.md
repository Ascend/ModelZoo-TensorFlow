# Label scripts

Everything that is about processing the label files and is framework independent.

- label_file_scripts.py is about "low level" label file handling, e.g. projecting markers into image space and opening label files
- visualize_labels.py draws labels into images
- spline_creator.py and segmentation_labels.py create outputs that may directly be used for training

See the deeplab sample script for an example to quickly use these scripts. There is lots that can be improved.
