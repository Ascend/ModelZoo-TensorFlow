The full dataset Kolektor Surface Defect Dataset (KolektorSDD) is available here.
We split the dataset into three folds to perform 3-fold cross validation. The splits are available at http://box.vicos.si/skokec/gostop/KolektorSDD-training-splits.zip.
Fully prepared TensorFlow dataset split into 3 folds is available at http://box.vicos.si/skokec/gostop/KolektorSDD-dilate=5-tensorflow.zip.
