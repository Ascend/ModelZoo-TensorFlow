The Navy attacked the big task force
They floated on the raft to sun their white backs
See the cat glaring at the scared mouse
He broke his ties with groups of former friends
There are more than two factors here
The spot on the blotter was made by green ink
The hat brim was wide and too droopy
Mud was spattered on the front of his white shirt
The lawyer tried to lose his case
The grass curled around the fence post
Cut the pie into large parts
Men strive but seldom get rich
This will lead the world to more sound and fury
Always close the barn door tight
He lay prone and hardly moved a limb
He carved a head from the round block of marble
