    :ivar str log_dir: Directory to write the generated files (e.g. the computed word-vectors) to and read/write checkoints from.
    :ivar int steps: How many training steps to perform.
    :ivar int vocabulary_size: How many words the vocabulary will have. Only the vocabulary_size most frequent words will be processed.
    :ivar int batch_size: How many trainings-samples to process per batch.
    :ivar int embedding_size: Dimension of the computed embedding vectors.
    :ivar int skip_window: How many words to consider left and right of the target-word maximally. The actual window is randomly sampled for each word between 1 and this value
    :ivar int num_sampled: Number of negative examples to sample when computing the nce_loss.
    :ivar int ngram_size: How large the ngrams (in which the target words are split) should be.
    :ivar int num_buckets: How many hash-buckets to use when hashing the ngrams to numbers.
    :ivar str validation_words: A string of comma-seperated words. The similarity of these words to each other will be regularily computed and printed to indicade the progress of the training.
    :ivar boolean profile: If set to True tensorflow will profile the graph-execution and writer results to ./profile.json.
    :ivar float learnrate: The starting learnrate for the training. The actual learnrate will lineraily decrease to beyth 0 when the specified amount of training-steps is reached.
    :ivar float rejection_threshold: In order to subsample the most frequent words.
    :ivar string job: The role of this node in a distributed setup. Can be worker' or 'ps'.
    :ivar str workers: A comma seperated list of host:port combinations representing the workers in the distributed setup.
    :ivar str ps: A comma seperated list of host:port combinations representing the parameter servers in the distributed setup. If empty a non-distributed setup is assumed.

    :ivar int index: The of the node itself in the list of --workers (or --ps, depending on --job).
