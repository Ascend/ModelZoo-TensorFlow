def dice(vol1, vol2, labels=None, nargout=1):
    '''
    Dice [1] volume overlap metric

    The default is to *not* return a measure for the background layer (label = 0)

    [1] Dice, Lee R. "Measures of the amount of ecologic association between species."
    Ecology 26.3 (1945): 297-302.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vol1 : nd array. The first volume (e.g. predicted volume)
    vol2 : nd array. The second volume (e.g. "true" volume)
    labels : optional vector of labels on which to compute Dice.
        If this is not provided, Dice is computed on all non-background (non-0) labels
    nargout : optional control of output arguments. if 1, output Dice measure(s).
        if 2, output tuple of (Dice, labels)

    Output
    ------
    if nargout == 1 : dice : vector of dice measures for each labels
    if nargout == 2 : (dice, labels) : where labels is a vector of the labels on which
        dice was computed
    '''
    if labels is None:
        labels = np.unique(np.concatenate((vol1, vol2)))

    dicem = np.zeros(len(labels))

        vol1l = vol1 == lab
        vol2l = vol2 == lab
        top = 2 * np.sum(np.logical_and(vol1l, vol2l))
        bottom = np.sum(vol1l) + np.sum(vol2l)
        bottom = np.maximum(bottom, np.finfo(float).eps)  # add epsilon.
        dicem[idx] = top / bottom

    if nargout == 1:
        return dicem
    else:
        return (dicem, labels)
