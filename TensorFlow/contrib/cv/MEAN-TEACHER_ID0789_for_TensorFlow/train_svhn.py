"""Train ConvNet Mean Teacher on SVHN training set and evaluate against a validation set

This runner converges quickly to a fairly good accuracy.
On the other hand, the runner experiments/svhn_final_eval.py
contains the hyperparameters used in the paper, and converges
much more slowly but possibly to a slightly better accuracy.
