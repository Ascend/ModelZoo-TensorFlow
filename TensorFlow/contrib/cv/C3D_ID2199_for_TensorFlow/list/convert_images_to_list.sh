# convert the images folder to the test.list and train.list file according to
#   the distribution, command will clear the train.list and test.list files first
#
#   Args:
#       path: the path to the video folder
#       factor: denominator that split the train and test data. if the number
#               is 4, then 1/4 of the data will be written to test.list and the
#               rest of the data will be written to train.list
#   Usage:
#       ./convert_images_to_list.sh path/to/video 4
#   Example Usage:
#       ./convert_images_to_list.sh ~/document/videofile 4
#   Example Output(train.list and test.list):
#       /Volumes/passport/datasets/action_kth/origin_images/boxing/person01_boxing_d1_uncomp 0
#       /Volumes/passport/datasets/action_kth/origin_images/boxing/person01_boxing_d2_uncomp 0
#       ...
