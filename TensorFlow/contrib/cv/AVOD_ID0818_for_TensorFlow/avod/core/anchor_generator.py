"""Base anchor generator.

The job of the anchor generator is to create (or load) a collection
of bounding boxes to be used as anchors.

Generated anchors are assumed to match some convolutional grid or list of grid
shapes.  For example, we might want to generate anchors matching an 8x8
feature map and a 4x4 feature map.  If we place 3 anchors per grid location
on the first feature map and 6 anchors per grid location on the second feature
map, then 3*8*8 + 6*4*4 = 288 anchors are generated in total.

To support fully convolutional settings, feature map shapes are passed
dynamically at generation time.  The number of anchors to place at each location
is static --- implementations of AnchorGenerator must always be able return
the number of anchors that it uses per location for each feature map.
