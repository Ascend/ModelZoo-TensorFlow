# Overview

In this work, we propose a novel multi-view deep subspace clustering network (MvDSCN) by learning a multi-view self-representation matrix in an end to end manner. 
MvDSCN consists of two sub-networks, i.e., diversity network (Dnet) and universality network (Unet). 
A latent space is built upon deep convolutional auto-encoders and a self-representation matrix is learned in the latent space using a fully connected layer. 
Dnet learns view-specific self-representation matrices while Unet learns a common self-representation matrix for all views. 
To exploit the complementarity of multi-view representations, Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) is introduced as a diversity regularization, which can capture
the non-linear and high-order inter-view relations. 
As different views share the same label space, the self-representation matrices of each view are aligned to the common one by a universality regularization.
